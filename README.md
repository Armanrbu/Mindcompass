# MindCompass

**A gamified, responsible mental health triage tool that navigates students and young professionals to appropriate support resources without diagnosis.**

## Core Principles

MindCompass is built on a foundation of trust, safety, and empowerment. Our goal is to provide a responsible and ethical tool for self-reflection and resource navigation.

*   **Security & Anonymity First:** Your privacy is paramount. We do not require personal identifiers like email or phone numbers. All journal entries are encrypted, and your data is **never** used to train public AI models. We use Supabase for secure data storage and management.
*   **Scientifically-Grounded:** The app utilizes clinically-recognized, standard screening questions to guide your self-reflection. This provides a structured and reliable foundation for gaining personal insight. Our question bank is curated from reputable sources to ensure they are safe and effective for self-assessment.
*   **Empowerment, Not Diagnosis:** MindCompass is a tool for self-awareness, **not a medical device**. It is explicitly designed to help you reflect on your emotional state, but it does **not** provide medical diagnoses. The goal is to empower you with insights to navigate your mental well-being and to connect you with professional help when needed.
